Functions---
            When we write code in the main function and we want this code run again and again. Then we have to write again and again, which takes a lot of time and effect, what if like we have the particular code in another function and we call the function whenever we want and use the function which decreases the time and effort and also the lines of code will be decreased.

            This will improve the code readbility and also the code reusebility. Less complex.




Function Decalaration: 
			As we are decalering variable in before while using same as we have to define the function as well.
			synatax-- type function_name(argments);

			Type: here type was the type of the value the function wants to return;
			if there is nothing to return type will be void;


			function name: here function can be anything but can not be same as the stl functions mean built in functions.


			arguments: these are one that function takes as an input as we can say that they have to taken which calling the funciton;




example:: 

		   int min();


		   void min();

		   string min();


		   double* min();



Definition: 
			Function definition: defining the function;

			without declaration of the function also we can define functions but we have to write or define the function before the usage of the function only;

			for example: 
			in main funcion we are calling min() function then we have to define the min() function before the main function();
